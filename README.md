# Bias in Zipf's Law Estimators

Code for the publication [Bias in Zipf's Law Estimators](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96214-w.pdf?proof=t%2Btarget%3D).

### data 
Data used and generated during the project.

### simulations
Scripts to run simulations such as simulating data to test estimator bias.

### utilities
Includes the code to run various estimators. Including Clauset et al's MLE, Hanel et al's MLE, and approximate Bayesian computation population monte carlo. 

### visualisation
All code used to generate figures in the paper. 

During the course of the project, more code and data was generated. This repo contains a minimal version of the code for the sake of keeping things simple and easy to find.
