# Bias in Zipf's Law Estimators

Code for the pubication "Bias in Zipf's Law Estimators" by Pilgrim & Hills, 2021. 

### data 
Data used and generated during the project

### simulations
Scripts to run simulations such as simulating data to test estimator bias

### utilities
Includes the code to run various estimators. Including Clauset et al's MLE, Hanel et al's MLE, and approximate Bayesian computation population monte carlo. 

### visualisation
All code used to generate figures in the paper. 

During the course of the project, more code and data was generated. This repo contains a minimal version of the code for the sake of keeping things simple and easy to find.
